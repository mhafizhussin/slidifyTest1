## Slidify -- 2nd Slide

- In this tutorial I am going to show you how to make a presentation just like this one
- I will also show some of the features that can be used in conjunction with slidify (i.e. quizzes and html widgets)
- You can download the current version of this presentation [here](https://github.com/jvcasill/slidify_tutorial/tree/gh-pages), use it as a template and edit as you like

## 3rd Slide

- `Slidify` works in R, so you need to download [that](http://cran.r-project.org) if you haven't yet.
- You also need to make sure you have all of the necessary dependencies installed on your computer
- Open R and copy and paste the following code into the console (you only need to do this once)
